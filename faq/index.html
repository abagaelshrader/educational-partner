            <h4>Is this right for my family?</h4>
            <p>More than likely yes! If you are a parent or guardian of a K-12 student and have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Needed to move learning home LONG-TERM due to COVID-19 concerns.</li>
              <li>Required to move learning home TEMPORARILY due to COVID-19 isolation. </li>
              <li>Recently decided to explore alternative learning from home IN ADDITION to regular school. </li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>Is this tutoring? </h4>
            <p>No. Although I love working directly with students and include that in Package #3, my primary goal is to empower and support parents.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>How does this work?</h4>
            <p>We discuss your student's learning style, strengths and interests, as well are your goals for this time at home. From there, I develop a personalized learning plan with specific goals, resources, lessons, and assessment opportunities. You start to implement them, and we communicate closely to make adaptations as needed to maximize your student's engagement level.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>In the packages, the focus is on one project or unit. What does this look like?</h4>
            <p>At the elementary level, this might look like developing and coding an interactive story on Scratch, or writing and presenting a persuasive speech on what happened to the dinosaurs. At the Junior High or High School level, it could look like a newspaper editorial on the history of pandemics and importance of scientific study, or using HTML/CSS to develop a website detailing your student's favorite vacation. Every unit will be cross-curricular and combine skills from multiple subjects (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies, etc.).</p>

            <h4>What skills can we focus on?</h4>
            <p>In the Initial Consultation, we will discuss your student's interests, strengths, and areas of growth. From here we can choose skills from </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h4>Can I work with you outside of packages?</h4>
            <p>Yes! The packages are provided for easy bundling, but add-ons and ala carte services are available as well. Schedule a 15 minute FREE consultation and we can discuss what works best for you and your student. </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>Can't I figure this out on my own?</h4>
            <p>Yup! You are 100% able and capable of doing this on your own. But you may not want to, or don’t have the time. That’s where I come into the picture.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>What if this doesn't work for my student?</h4>
            <p>You know your student best, and I have certainly learned as a teacher that sometimes a lesson just fails. We will work together to find a plan and resources that work for you and your student. The hardest (and best) part of teaching is learning and adapting based on your student's needs.</p>
