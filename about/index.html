              <p>Hi! My name is Abagael Shrader and I am so excited that you are here. My favorite part about working with students is when the student AND their parents are able to share their learning experiences. In the past five years, I have had the opportunity to work closely with students and teachers to enrich classroom experiences and challenge ways of thinking. My work is rooted in the belief that: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-2">
              <p><span>Every child should be challenged every day.</span></p>
              <p>In a regular year, there are many hurdles for schools and teachers to overcome (funding, resources, training, time, etc.). Unfortunately, this year has added yet another - COVID-19. With social distancing, potential quarantines, and just an overall added stress to the school day, our classrooms just don’t look the same this year.</p>
              <p>Working with students at all grade levels, I have first hand experience of the issues that arise when students are stressed, bored, or unengaged in their learning. I come from a unique background and therefore am able to help students connect their interests, social and emotional needs, and academic challenge to our lessons. I strongly believe that students are capable of learning absolutely anything they put their mind to - they just need the proper supports. That’s where you and I come in.</p>
              <p>Finding what those supports look like can be daunting. Not only are there millions of digital resources (paid and free) out there looking beautiful and helpful, there are also hundreds of ways to teach a single lesson or concept. There is no right or wrong way to do this, but the options are endless (and stressful and time-consuming). Because this role of teacher is new to many parents, I want to help YOU be a better academic support for your student. It is unfortunate that many of our students will not be in classrooms like normal this year, but as parents - you have knowledge that will make you an exceptional teacher for your student, even if that’s only temporary.</p>
              <h4>My goal is to support YOU (parents and guardians) in this new role as teacher. </h4>
              <p>Learn about what supports are available:</p>

            <h3>My Background</h4>
            <p>I was born and raised in Iowa and currently reside just outside Iowa City, IA. I graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts with a degree in Anthropology and Biology. And I have a Master’s degree in Social Studies Education from the University of Iowa. I have an Iowa teaching license with endorsements in K-12 Talented and Gifted Education, K-12 Computer Science, and 5-12 All Social Studies (Government, U.S. History, Psychology, Sociology, World History, Geography, Economics).</p>
            <h5>Why I am not a classroom teacher this year:</h4>
            <p>I have worked in a district in southern Iowa for three years in the same position. I loved my students and my coworkers, but the same funding was not available to me for the 20-21 school year. For that reason, I chose to leave and explore other options.</p>
